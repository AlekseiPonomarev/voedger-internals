## Concepts

### Problem Statement, Objectives

| Aspect              | Problem Statement                         | Objectives                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Explains the issue or gap being addressed. | Defines the specific goals to achieve.  |
| **Focus**           | *Why* the research is important.          | *What* the research aims to accomplish. |
| **Nature**          | Descriptive and contextual.               | Prescriptive and actionable.            |
| **Level of Detail** | Broad and focuses on the overall problem.  | Specific and operational.               |
| **Examples**        | Identifies the problem (e.g., lack of reliable assessment methods). | Outlines the solution steps (e.g., develop and validate a framework). |

### Literature Review, Related Work, Background

Here’s a detailed comparison between **Literature Review**, **Related Work**, and **Background** presented in a table:

| **Aspect**        | **Literature Review**                         | **Related Work**                            | **Background**                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Provides a broad overview of the existing body of knowledge, identifying gaps and justifying the need for the research. | Focuses on closely related studies, emphasizing how the current work builds on or differs from them. | Explains foundational concepts, theories, or context needed to understand the paper. |
| **Scope**         | Broad, covering a wide range of studies and trends in the field. | Narrow, specific to works that directly influence the research problem or solution. | General and focused on the reader’s understanding of the topic. |
| **Content**       | Synthesizes prior work, categorizes it into themes or trends, and identifies research gaps. | Summarizes and compares prior work directly relevant to the current study, often highlighting methods or results. | Introduces key concepts, definitions, history, or context needed to frame the problem or approach. |
| **Placement**     | Typically after the Introduction or as part of the Introduction. | Often placed after the Introduction and before Methodology. | Usually within or immediately after the Introduction. |
| **Style**         | Analytical and evaluative, organized by themes or trends in the literature. | Comparative and specific, highlighting direct connections to the current work. | Explanatory and didactic, designed to inform and orient the reader. |
| **Focus**         | Field-wide, showing the state of the art and trends. | Directly related studies, contrasting their approaches or results with the current research. | Conceptual or contextual, ensuring readers understand the problem and terminology. |
| **Examples of Use** | “Studies in X have primarily focused on Y, leaving Z unexplored...” | “Unlike the approach used by Smith et al. (2020), our method improves accuracy by 20%...” | “The concept of Z, introduced by A in 1980, refers to...” |
| **Common in**     | Academic papers in fields like social sciences, humanities, and broad scientific research. | Technical papers, especially in computer science, engineering, or applied research. | Papers with specialized audiences who may lack familiarity with the specific topic. |
