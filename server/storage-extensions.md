# State Storage Extensions

- [GitHub Issue #2366](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/issues/2366)

We have a number of built-in state storages, but there should be a way to extend the state storage capabilities:
- [Ephemeral Storage](https://github.com/voedger/voedger-internals/blob/main/server/ephemeral-storage.md)

## Analysis

Currently, we can load storage as a Go plugin. There are two approaches:

1. Load plugins when Voedger starts (Sidecar Storage Extensions)
2. Load plugins as a part of the application (Per-app Storage Extensions)

|                             | Sidecar Storage Extensions | Per-app Storage Extensions |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| More stable                 | Yes üëç                     | No                         |
| More memory problems        | No üëç                      | Yes                        |
| Upgradable                  | No                         | Yes üëç                     |
| Easy to operate             | No                         | Yes üëç                     |
| Easy to develop             | No                         | Yes üëç                     |

We will start with the Per-app Storage Extensions approach since it is easier to implement. Sidecar Storage Extensions' advantages matter when we host a lot of applications and do not want them to provide their own storage extensions (storage extensions are unsafe).

## Principles

- State Storage Extension is deployed as a part of an Application Image
- State Storage Extension is a Go plugin
  - Plugins are currently supported only on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS
  - If a Storage Extension is updated, some resources related to the previous instance are wasted
  - Multiple versions of a Storage Extension can be instantiated
  - Storage must have a `Free()` method that is called when a storage instance is not needed anymore
  - Storage must have an `ILogger` interface as an input parameter
- Package, development structure:
  - üìÇpackage folder
    - üìÇwasm
      - .go files
    - üìÇstorages
      - .go files
    - .vsql files
- App Image structure:
  - üìÇpackage folder
    - .vsql files
    - pkg.wasm
    - `storages-$version.so` // multiple storages
- App Partition deployment
  - `storages-$version.so` is copied (if needed) to some internal `storages` folder and loaded from there
- IAppPartition.Storage(FullQName) state.IStateStorage
  - // Created during app deployment from iextrowstorage.IRowStorage by appparts.NewIStateStorage(appdef IAppDef, iextrowstorage.IRowStorage)
  - // appdef is needed for typechecking
- pkg/iextsse // State Storage Extensions
  - üìÇgoplugin
  - IStateStorage

## Principles: Configuration

üìÇpkg/air:
```sql
STATESTORAGE ENGINE BUILTIN (

  Ephemeral (
    GET         SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
    INSERT      SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
    UPDATE      SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
  ) WITH JSONCONFIG=` 
      {
        "LRUCaches": {
          "Cache1": {
            "PartitionMaxSize": "${Ephemeral_PartitionMaxSize:-50000000}" // The syntax is taken from bash.
          },
          "Cache2": {
            "PartitionMaxSize": 50000000
          }
        }
      }
`;
);
```

üìÇpkg/scada:
```sql
STATESTORAGE ENGINE GOPLUGIN (
  SCADA (
    GET         SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
    INSERT      SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
    UPDATE      SCOPE(COMMAND, QUERY, PROJECTOR, JOB),
  ) WITH JSONCONFIG=` 
      {
        "URL": "${SCADA_PartitionMaxSize:-"127.0.0.1:8765"}" // Note how double quotes are used.
        "Password": "${SCADA_Password:-"0123"}" 
      }
`;
);
```

Application Deployment Descriptor:
```json
{
  "NumPartitions":100,
  "NumAppWorkspaces":10,
  "PackageConfigs": {
    "air":{
      "Ephemeral_PartitionMaxSize":1000000
    },
    "scada":{
      "URL":"https://myscadaurl.io",
      "Password":"$SCADA_PASSWORD"
    }    
  }
}
```

ctool, create a secret:
```bash
ctool secret create SCADA_PASSWORD <my-secret-password>
```



## Functional design

### Ephemeral storage

vsql:
```
STATESTORAGE ENGINE BUILTIN (
  EphemeralBills
  
)
STATESTORAGE ENGINE GOPLUGIN (
    STORAGE Http (
        READ SCOPE(QUERIES, PROJECTORS, JOBS)
    );
)
```

Purpose. Store

- Developer prepares an app image with the storages-2.so
- DevOps deploys the image
- Server
