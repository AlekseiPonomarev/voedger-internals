# Storage Extensions

- [GitHub Issue #2366](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/issues/2366)

We have a number of built-in storages, but there should be a way to extend the storage capabilities.

## Analysis

Currently, we can load storage as a Go plugin. There are two approaches:

1. Load plugins when Voedger starts (Sidecar Storage Extensions)
2. Load plugins as a part of the application (Per-app Storage Extensions)

|                             | Sidecar Storage Extensions | Per-app Storage Extensions |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| More stable                 | Yes 👍                     | No                         |
| Can cause memory problems   | No 👍                      | Yes                        |
| Upgradable                  | No                         | Yes 👍                     |
| Easy to operate             | No                         | Yes 👍                     |
| Easy to develop             | No                         | Yes 👍                     |

We will start with the Per-app Storage Extensions approach since it is easier to implement. Sidecar Storage Extensions' advantages matter when we host a lot of applications and do not want them to provide their own storage extensions (storage extensions are unsafe).

## Principles

- Storage Extension deployed as a part of an Application Image
- Storage Extension is a Go plugin
  - Plugins are currently supported only on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS
  - If a Storage Extension is updated, some resources related to the previous instance are wasted
  - Multiple versions of a Storage Extension can be instantiated
  - Storage must have a `Free()` method that is called when a storage instance is not needed anymore
  - Storage must have an `ILogger` interface as an input parameter
- Package, development structure:
  - 📂package folder
    - 📂wasm
      - .go files
    - 📂storages
      - .go files
    - .vsql files
- App Image structure:
  - 📂package folder
    - .vsql files
    - pkg.wasm
    - `storages-$version.so` // multiple storages
- App Partition deployment
  - `storages-$version.so` is copied (if needed) to some `storages` folder and loaded from there
- IAppPartition.Storage(FullQName) IStorage // QName ???
- pkg/iextstgengine
  - 📂goplugin
  - IStateStorage
- Refactor current sources: pkg/sys/storages
- STATESTORAGE ENGINE BUILTIN
- STATESTORAGE ENGINE GOPLUGIN
